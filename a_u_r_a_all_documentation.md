8. Technical Architecture & Stack (MVP Focus)
8.1. High-Level Architecture

The A.U.R.A MVP operates on a hybrid cloud-local model:

Client-Side / On-Premises:

Stores all sensitive client data locally.

Runs AI models (forecasting and rule-based decision engine) to ensure data privacy and compliance.

Supports dashboard access via the local Streamlit UI.

Cloud Backend:

Manages model deployment, updates, monitoring, and orchestration metadata.

Does not process sensitive client data. Only telemetry, logs, or anonymized metadata are sent to the cloud.

8.2. Frontend / Dashboard (MVP)

Framework: Streamlit (Python-native, minimal setup, supports widgets).

Primary Purpose: Display core client KPIs, visualizations, and AI-driven insights.

Key Features for MVP:

KPI panels: Client health scores, churn risk levels, engagement metrics.

Charts: Line, bar, scatter, and basic heatmaps (via Plotly).

Filters: Date ranges, client segments, and tiers.

Basic chatbot integration for querying dashboards.

Note: Power BI / Looker Studio are not used in MVP, only considered for future production dashboards.

8.3. MVP Technology Stack
Category	Library / Tool	Purpose / Notes
Data Handling	pandas, numpy	Load and manipulate datasets for dashboard and AI processing.
Exploratory Analysis	sweetviz	Quick EDA and data quality reports during development.
AI Modeling	Prophet	Forecasting client behavior and engagement trends.
Rule-Based Engine	Custom Python scripts	Evaluate client churn risk and generate recommended actions.
Dashboard / UI	streamlit	Build MVP dashboard and integrate chatbot interface.
Visualizations	plotly	Interactive charts for dashboards (line, bar, scatter, heatmaps).
Optional Charts	matplotlib, seaborn	Static chart generation for internal testing or prototyping.
Model Persistence	joblib	Save/load AI models and rule engine objects locally.
Optional AutoML	Hugging Face AutoTrain	Rapid prototyping for MVP model training if required.
8.4. MVP Design Principles

Simplicity & Speed: Focus on essential dashboards and chatbot functionality.

Data Privacy: All sensitive client data stays local.

Python-Native Stack: Enables fast development and hackathon delivery.

Scalability Awareness: Architecture supports future cloud or multi-client scaling without redesign.

AI Model Inference Performance (Local on Client Servers)
*   **Target Response Time:** <500 ms for real-time decision support or recommendations; up to 1–2 seconds for batch scoring.
*   **Scalability Considerations:** Each client’s server must have sufficient CPU/GPU resources to handle concurrent inferences if multiple users trigger actions simultaneously.
*   **Rule-Based Engine (MVP):** Should return recommendations in <200–500 ms per client evaluation and scale efficiently.

10.4. Chatbot / Interactive AI Performance
*   **Target Response Time:**
    *   Real-time chat interactions: <1 second for local AI responses.
    *   If cloud orchestration is involved: <2 seconds.
*   **Scalability Considerations:** Maintain stateless session management to support multiple simultaneous chatbot interactions. Use autoscaling instances or serverless endpoints if hosted centrally.
